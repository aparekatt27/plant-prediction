This notebook demonstrates a plant disease classification task using various deep learning models with transfer learning. 
The goal is to classify plant leaf images into different disease categories or 'healthy'. 

We will explore and compare the performance of EfficientNetV2B0, ResNet50V2, MobileNetV3Large, and a Vision Transformer (ViT) model.
